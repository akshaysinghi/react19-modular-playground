# React19 modular playground
A modular, microfrontend-ready React 19 project that showcases all major React features, hooks, and advanced patterns — designed as a playground for learning, experimenting, and building scalable frontends.

# 🧩 Key Features

✅ React 19: Latest features including use, useOptimistic, useFormState, useTransition, and more

🧱 Microfrontend Architecture using Module Federation

📦 Modular Design: Each feature lives in its own independent module (login, dashboard, forms, etc.)

🌐 Shared Components & Utils via internal packages

⚡ Built with Vite (optionally pluggable with Next.js or Turborepo)

🧠 Ideal for learning enterprise-scale frontend practices
